Not only does he have a four-year degree in Adolescence German, but he is also trained in surveillance and karate. Not to mention he has been the most cherished Assistant Regional Manager and best salesman Dunder Mifflin Paper Company has ever seen. His wide range of interests and specialized hobbies make him the most talked about businessman at the Honesdale Rotary Club. Dwight Schrute: the man, the myth, and the building owner."
